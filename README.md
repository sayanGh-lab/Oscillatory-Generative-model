Instruction:1st run the code (eeg_48ch_wake_combined.m) with nearbyA.m function loaded in the same directory, with a sample time series (For example:   eeg_nrem_n3_all_ch.mat). Then network will learn frequency of oscillator. Also angle of lateral connection will be trained in this phase. Then store the updated frequency and phase values (angle of lateral conncetion) for further use.
Though the model is developed for all 62 /42 channels you can start with single channel also.
